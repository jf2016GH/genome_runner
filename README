# Tuning pyBedTools

BEDTools also creates LOTS of tempfiles.
Open /etc/security/limits.conf and add:
	*	hard	nofile	1000000
	*	soft	nofile	1000000

# Project structure
* data/ contains the BED files and hg19.genome (chromosome lengths) used in analyses
* genome_runner contains actual Python code:
	* server.py accepts user input and renders results.
	* query.py runs analyses.
* templates/ contains HTML templates. Their data is filled in by Python code before being returned to the user.
* static/ contains css, js, images, etc.
* results/ stores user's analysis results in Python "Pickle" format.
* uploads/ stores user's uploaded BED files.

# Starting the server
Navigate to the project directory (the same one that this README is in).
Run
	python -m genome_runner.server [optional port#]

By default the server is run on port 8081..


# Unit testing
Unit testing done with Nose
Run from /genome_runner/genom_runner
