There are two important modules in this package:

1) grsnp.server
2) grsnp.dbcreator


Installing the database
=======================

The grsnp.dbcreator automatically generates the database needed to GRSNP.

Quickstart version
------------------

The GRSNP database can be generated with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m grsnp.dbcreator -g hg19 -d ~/Documents/gr_data

The -d argument designates where the database is to be installed. This exact path should be passed to grsnp.server.

The dbcreator works in several steps:

* Download required files from USCS and place in ~/Documents/gr_data/downloads
* Convert files into standard bed format.  Unsupported data formats are skipped. Converted files are placed in /gr_data/grsnp_db/[organism]. 
*
