There are two important modules in this package:

1) grsnp.server
2) grsnp.dbcreator


Installing the database
=======================

The GRSNP database can be generated with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m grsnp.dbcreator -g hg19 -d ~/Documents/gr_data

The -d parameter designates where the database is to be installed. This exact path should be passed to grsnp.server.
The DBcreator performs several steps:

* Downloads required files from USCS and place in [dir]/downloads/
* Converts files into standard bed format and zip with bgzip.  Unsupported data formats are skipped.
* Places converted files are placed in [dir]/grsnp_db/[organism]/[group]/[tier]/

FAQ
---

* How do I install multiple organism?
  
   * Simply re-run the DBcreator and designate a different organism with the -g parameter.

* Can I run the DBcreator on an existing database?
  
   * Yes, the DBcreator detects which GFs have already been installed.
   
* The DBcreator is taking a long time to run.  Can I 'kill' it?
  
   * Yes, the DBcreator flags partially completed GFs with a '.tmp' extension.  These GFs are not visible to the server.

* Can I download individual GFs?
  
   * Individual GFs can be installed by giving the name to the -f parameter (i.e '-f knownGene' ).

* Is Rsync supported?
  
   * Rsync can be used to mirror the USCS data files .. code-block:: bash
   
       INSERT CODE
   * Before downloading any files, the DBcreator checks the [dir]/downloads/ directory for the required files.
